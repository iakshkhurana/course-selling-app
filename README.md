## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/iakshkhurana/course-selling-app.git
cd course-selling-app
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

In the `backend` directory, create a `.env` file and add the following required variables. Your server will not start without this file.

```env
# /backend/.env

# Your MongoDB connection string
MONGO_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/your_db_name"

# JWT secrets (replace with your own long, random strings)
JWT_USER_PASSWORD="your_user_secret"
JWT_ADMIN_PASSWORD="your_admin_secret"

# The secret key required for new admin signups
ADMIN_SECRET_KEY="course-sellerx"
```

### 3. Install Dependencies & Run the App

This project requires two terminals to run both the frontend and backend servers simultaneously.

**In Terminal 1 (run the backend):**
```sh
# Navigate to the backend folder
cd backend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
node index.js
```
> The backend will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

**In Terminal 2 (run the frontend):**
```sh
# Navigate to the frontend folder
cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```
> The frontend will be running on a port like `http://localhost:5173`.
